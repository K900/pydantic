For types that are more complex, or don't need to be on Pydantic itself, we have the [Pydantic Extra Types] project.

The following types are supported by [Pydantic Extra Types]:

* [Color Types](../color_types) &mdash; color validation types.
* [Payment Card Numbers](../payment_cards) &mdash; a type that allows you to store payment card numbers in your model.
* [Phone Numbers](../phone_numbers) &mdash; a type that allows you to store phone numbers in your model.
* [Routing Numbers](../routing_numbers) &mdash; a type that allows you to store ABA transit routing numbers in your model.
